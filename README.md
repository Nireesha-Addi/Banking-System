## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/` – Java source code
- `database/` – SQL schema
- `screenshots/` – Application output screenshots

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- JDBC connectivity
- Prepared Statements (SQL Injection prevention)
- Exception Handling
- Modular code design


## How It Works
- Users create an account using the console interface
- Login is validated against the MySQL database
- Banking operations are performed using JDBC queries
- Data is securely stored and retrieved from the database

## Database
- MySQL database with tables for user details and transactions
- Uses Prepared Statements to prevent SQL Injection

## Learning Outcomes
